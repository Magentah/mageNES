✔ Do something about memory access. @created(20-04-15 00:50) @done(20-04-18 17:25)
    Memory Access right now basically just access ROM only, randomly accessing RAM for some opcodes.
    There's no actual checking of address ranges to know what to try to access memory for.
    This is causing issues now with the test rom file starting to access RAM, then getting ROM data back.

☐ Setup SDL and OpenGL to have a window of some sort. @created(20-04-15 00:53)
    Not really necessary while working on CPU, but at some point there will need to be a window...
    ☐ glTexImage2D to create a base texture that will then be updated with glTexSubImage2D @created(20-04-20 16:03)
    ☐ Use glTexSubImage2D to update an existing 2d texture with pixel data from the PPU. @created(20-04-20 16:02)
    ☐ Scale glTexImage2D for different resolutions? @created(20-04-20 16:03)

☐ Setup ImGUI @created(20-04-15 00:54)
    Easy to use to add debug stuff to a window, instead of reading through terminal for everything.
    Will need it at some point, same as a window..
    ☐ Debug window? e.g. show register values, show instrction call list, show memory, etc @created(20-04-20 16:04)

✔ Next thing to get working -- RTI @created(20-04-16 23:49) @done(20-04-17 12:32)
    Fails on Cyc 2183 currently. First RTI call.

✔ Implement unofficial opcodes correctly, accounting for address mode @created(20-04-17 16:36) @done(20-04-19 17:40)
    Currently all unsupported opcodes are assumed to be 2 bytes, which is incorrect. 3 byte unsupported opcodes break test.
    ✔ NOPs @created(20-04-18 17:24) @done(20-04-18 17:25)
    ✔ Valid opcodes that are unofficial. @created(20-04-18 17:24) @done(20-04-19 17:40)
