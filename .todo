☐ Do something about memory access. @created(20-04-15 00:50)
    Memory Access right now basically just access ROM only, randomly accessing RAM for some opcodes.
    There's no actual checking of address ranges to know what to try to access memory for.
    This is causing issues now with the test rom file starting to access RAM, then getting ROM data back.

☐ Setup SDL and OpenGL to have a window of some sort. @created(20-04-15 00:53)
    Not really necessary while working on CPU, but at some point there will need to be a window...

☐ Setup ImGUI @created(20-04-15 00:54)
    Easy to use to add debug stuff to a window, instead of reading through terminal for everything.
    Will need it at some point, same as a window..
